# NetScope

**NetScope** is a simple, lightweight tool that helps you detect the CIDR block and IP class of any given IP address.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Detects CIDR notation for IPv4 addresses
- âœ… Identifies traditional IP address classes (A, B, C, D, E)
- âœ… Simple to use, lightweight, and easy to integrate
- âœ… Great for learning, quick lookups, or network tools

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

NetScope analyzes any IPv4 address:
- Checks which range the address falls into
- Determines its network class (based on legacy classful networking)
- Calculates the CIDR block representation if needed
- Outputs the results in a clear, human-friendly format

## ðŸš€ Usage

**Example**

bash
# Example usage
python netscope.py 192.168.1.1


Expected output:

IP Address: 192.168.1.1
Class: C
CIDR: 192.168.1.0/24
